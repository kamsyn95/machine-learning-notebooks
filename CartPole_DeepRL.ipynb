In this task, rewards are +1 for every incremental timestep and the environment terminates if the pole falls over too far or the cart moves more then 2.4 units away from center. This means better performing scenarios will run for longer duration, accumulating larger return.\n","\n","The CartPole task is designed so that the inputs to the agent are 4 real values representing the environment state (position, velocity, etc.). However, neural networks can solve the task purely by looking at the scene, so we’ll use a patch of the screen centered on the cart as an input. \n","\n","Strictly speaking, we will present the state as the difference between the current screen patch and the previous one.
